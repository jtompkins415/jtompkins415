**John here!** 

I'm a software engineer who recently graduated from a software engineering bootcamp. I have a strong proficiency in **JavaScript**, **Python**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, **JQuery**, **Git/Terminal/Github**, and I enjoy working with and learning new technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy **gaming** 🎮, **watching sports (🏀 and 🏈)**, and **traveling** 🛫🛫. I believe in continuous learning and personal growth, and I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.

I am passionate about developing elegant and efficient software solutions that solve real-world problems. I am excited to collaborate with other talented developers to build innovative products and services that make a difference in people's lives.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
